# deeplearning4j-sentiment-example

This deep learning project is an extract of the Word2Vec sentiment example from 
the  DeepLearnin4J examples.

It has been modified to separate the training from the evaluation of the  trained model.

A volohai.yaml file was added to facilitate building, training and evaluation into 
separate steps.

The main objective of this project is to pass an arbitrary text blurb to the trained 
model and have it determine if it is presented in a positive or negative context.
